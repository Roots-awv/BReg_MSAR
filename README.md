# Bayesian Regularization DLVM

This repository contains additional materials and codes used in the manuscript titled: _'Are Bayesian Regularization Methods a Must for Multilevel Dynamic Latent Variables Models?'_

Figures that could not be presented in the manuscript are included in the pdf document entitled _"supplementary_materials.pdf"_.  In particular, convergence rates and sampling accuracy rates are presented. In addition, we have also presented measures such as relative bias, absolute bias, root mean square error (RMSE), coverage rates and type I error rates.

We also share here the code and syntaxes used to generate the data and to compute the results. The
